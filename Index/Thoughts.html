      Reading #1 Jenny Odell’s How to Internet spotlights the evolution of
      community and relationship between strangers on the internet. Odell
      reminiscences on the feeling of connection with strangers online due to
      the internet’s smaller size. She provides examples of these encounters,
      recalling one interaction with a stranger from Russia on Second life, an
      online virtual world game from the mid-2000s. Odell contrasts these
      coincidental, random experiences to today’s algorithm based filtered
      content. I definitely sympathize with Odell’s longing for this “old”
      internet as my childhood consisted of online avatar games, random Korean
      game websites, and “how to internet” videos that I would not be able to
      stumble across today. Lauren Schwult’s, My website is a shifting house
      next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?, goes into depth on the
      practicalities and implications of a website. Schwult uses metaphors to
      break down certain attributes to a website, comparing a site to multiple
      tangible and physical objects, such as a room, a shelf, a plant, etc..
      Though Schwult’s use of metaphors form a stark contrast between the
      internet and the physical world it somehow simultaneously merges the two
      together. This unification of these two dissimilar ideas make this article
      that much more intriguing. Is today’s algorithm-based, filtered, and
      specified internet more favorable than the older, random, and less
      catered-to internet favored by Odell? Obviously, today’s internet is a
      product of growing consumer tendencies, but do the pros of navigability
      and ease of use outweigh the pros of the “old” internet’s communal
      environment and overall connectability? Would you say “trolls” are a
      byproduct of/encouraged by the internet’s anonymity? What else could you
      see the internet evolving into, considering the increase in popularity and
      ease of access of virtual reality . Reading #2 Archiving a Revolution in
      the Digital Age, Archiving as an Act of Resistance by Lara Baladi does a
      great job of explaining the archive movement that occurred during the 2011
      Egypt Revolution. Baladi focuses on the 18 days of revolution in Tahrir
      Square, one of the most "documented and mediatized events in the digital
      age". The extreme amount of documentation in Tahrir Square led to
      revolutionary artists continuing this weaponization of archiving and art
      after the 18 days in Tahrir Square. Artists were revolutionizing how,
      when, and where they worked and also which mediums they worked with.
      People began experimenting with more visual and performative arts out on
      the streets of Cairo and others decided to graffiti walls of significant
      locations as a finger to the oppressive state. This movement inevitably
      broadcasted the events of the Egypt Revolution to the rest of the world,
      spreading revolutionary art to people on the other side of the globe.
      Peter Soulellis’ talk relates to the first article, aforementioned,
      exploring the concept of the art in limited/oppressed states. Peter talks
      about queer art and the different design languages and overall aesthetics
      that can be used to empower lgbtq+ movements. He relates these ideas back
      to personal experiences as a queer man and stresses the importance of
      design and media in any sort of movement. What would have happened if the
      18 days in Tahrir Square had not been archived as it had been? Do
      limitations push artists to become more creative? Would you say that art
      is revolutionized more so by limitations/restrictions than without?
      Reading #3 I’ve always visualized the internet as something intangible and
      almost abstract, however, the video definitely helps put things into
      perspective and makes it much easier to visualize how everything works. I
      guess I thought I would be more surprised when hearing that DARPA was one
      of the first on the concept of the internet, but seeing as this all
      happened in the 1950s after wwii, I’m not as shocked. It is weird thinking
      of how women, such as Mary Anne Wilkes, Betty Jean Jennings, and Fran
      Bilas, some of the first “computer girls” were swept under the rug by
      history, and now computer science is a grossly male dominated field. I
      guess I wouldn’t expect much more from the states though. Reading #4 Black
      Gooey Universe by American Artist concerns the dominance of whitepeople
      and its consequences on Silicon Valley and the development of GUIs and
      computers overall. American Artist explains the commercialization of the
      internet and the push for anti-black products, the most prominent example
      being the Apple Lisa. The Apple Lisa was the first computer with a
      GUI,changing the monitor screen from black to white. This change in the
      1970s represented the erasure of blackness and installation of whiteness,
      in its place. The second article, Rich User Experience, UX and
      Desktopnization of War, Olia Lialina writes about the quickly evolving
      meaning of UX/User Interface. Don Norman, the creator of the idea of UX
      recalled in 2007, “Since then the term has spread widely, so that it is
      starting to lose its meaning”. Nowadays, UX is mainly used to hide
      programmability and customizability, detaching the user from the computer
      and/or the reason the person may be on the computer. For example, the use
      of UX to dehumanize human targets in order to reduce ptsd for drone
      pilots, is an example of UX being used to detach the user from the
      computer/action. Aside from the change from a black screen to white
      screen, what are some ways in which the tech industry has favored
      whiteness over blackness? Is there any way to fix this issue? Do the pros
      of UX/User Interface/Experience outweigh the cons?
