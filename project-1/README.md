[No Escape](https://seanjin1029.github.io/IML300/project-1/page-1.html) is an interactive storyline exploring the ideas of taxes and its consequences in the United States.

### Description

This project plays with the idea of taxes while also serving as commentary on the United States’ foreign policy, income inequality, and policing. I wanted to create this abstract storyline from the perspective of a regular citizen so the first page gives two options. If you choose to pay your taxes, you reach the first ending- “You are a good citizen!” is written across the top as drone strike footage from the middle east plays on repeat. If you choose not to pay your taxes, you are taken down a rabbithole of homelessness/income statistics and police racial profiling data and eventually CIA conspiracies. The two endings down this path are similarly just as bad, one looping you back to the beginning (representing the inability to escape the system) and the second representing your capture by the government along with an article on the privatized, for-profit, prison system.
