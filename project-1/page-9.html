        "Private prisons in the United States incarcerated 115,428 people in
        2019, representing 8% of the total state and federal prison population.
        Since 2000, the number of people housed in private prisons has increased
        32% compared to an overall rise in the prison population of 3%. However,
        the private prison population has declined 16% since reaching its peak
        in 2012 with 137,220 people. Declines in private prisons’ use make these
        latest overall population numbers the lowest since 2006 when the
        population was 113,791. States show significant variation in their use
        of private correctional facilities. Indeed, Montana held 47% of its
        prison population in private facilities, while 20 states did not employ
        any for-profit prisons. Data compiled by the Bureau of Justice
        Statistics (BJS) and interviews with corrections officials find that in
        2019, 30 states and the federal government incarcerated people in
        private facilities run by corporations including GEO Group, Core Civic
        (formerly Corrections Corporation of America), LaSalle Corrections, and
        Management and Training Corporation. Twenty states with private prison
        contracts incarcerate more than 500 people in for-profit prisons. Texas,
        the first state to adopt private prisons in 1985, incarcerated the
        largest number of people under state jurisdiction, 12,516. Since 2000,
        the number of people in private prisons has increased 32%. In eight
        states the private prison population has more than doubled during this
        time period: Arizona (480%), Indiana (313%), Ohio (253%), North Dakota
        (221%), Florida (205%), Montana (125%), Tennessee (118%), and Georgia
        (110%). The Federal Bureau of Prisons maintains the nation’s highest
        number of people managed by private prison contractors. Since 2000, its
        use increased 77%, and the number of people in private federal custody —
        which includes prisons, half-way houses and home confinement — totaled
        27,409 in 2019. While a significant historical increase, the population
        declined 33% since its peak in 2013, likely reflecting the continuing
        decline of the overall federal prison population. This number will
        continue to drop as a result of President Biden’s recent executive order
        to phase out federal contracts with private prison companies. Among the
        immigrant detention population, 40,634 people – 81% of the detained
        population – were confined in privately run facilities in 2019. The
        privately detained immigrant population grew 739% since 2002 to 2019.1)
        Biden’s executive order does not limit private contracts with immigrant
        detention facilities. Political influences have been instrumental in
        determining the growth of for-profit private prisons and continue today.
        However, if overall prison populations continue the current trend of
        modest declines, the privatization debate will likely intensify as
        opportunities for the prison industry dry up and corrections companies
        seek profit in other areas of criminal justice services and immigration
        detention."
