      The US Department of the Treasury poisoned alcohol during Prohibition —
      and people died: The 18th Amendment, which took effect in January 1920,
      banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol — but not
      consumption. Despite the government's efforts, alcoholism actually
      skyrocketed during the era. To keep up with America's thirst, bootleggers
      not only created their own alcohol but also stole industrial versions,
      rendered undrinkable by the inclusion of certain chemicals (namely methyl
      alcohol). Liquor syndicates then employed chemists to "re-nature" the
      alcohol once again, making it safe for consumption, according to Deborah
      Blum, author of "The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic
      Medicine in Jazz Age New York." By mid-1927, however, the US government
      added much deadlier chemicals — kerosene, chloroform, and acetone among
      those most well known — which made alcohol more difficult to render
      consumable again. Adding 10% more methyl alcohol caused the worst effects.
      Although New York City's chief medical examiner, Charles Norris, tried to
      publicize the dangers, in 1926, poisonous alcohol killed 400 in the city.
      The next year, 700 died. The US Public Health Service lied about treating
      black men with syphilis for more than 40 years: In 1932, the Public Health
      Service collaborated with the Tuskegee Institute to record the history of
      syphilis in the black male community, hoping to justify a treatment
      program. Called the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro
      Male, the study initially included 600 black men — 399 with the disease
      and 201 without. While the men were told they would receive treatment,
      however, the researchers never provided adequate treatment for the
      disease. Even when penicillin became the preferred and available treatment
      for syphilis, researchers kept their subjects in the dark. Although
      originally planned to last only six months, the experiment continued for
      40 years. Finally, in 1972, an Associated Press article prompted public
      outrage and a subsequent investigation. A government advisory panel deemed
      the study "ethically irresponsible" and research ended almost immediately.
      As a result, the government settled a class-action lawsuit out of court in
      1974 for $10 million and lifetime health benefits for all participants,
      the last of whom died in 2004. More than 100 million Americans received a
      polio vaccine contaminated with a potentially cancer-causing virus: From
      1954 to 1961, simian virus 40 (SV40) somehow showed up in polio vaccines,
      according to the American Journal of Cancer. Researchers estimate 98
      million people in the US, and even more worldwide, received contaminated
      inoculations. Jonas Salk, creator of the inactivated-polio vaccine, used
      cells from rhesus monkeys infected with SV40, according to president of
      the National Vaccine Information Center Barbara Fisher, who testified
      before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness in the US House of
      Representatives on this matter in 2003, after researching the situation
      for 10 years. The federal government changed oral-vaccine stipulations in
      1961 — which didn't include Salk's inactivated polio vaccine —
      specifically citing SV40. But medical professionals continued to
      administer tainted vaccines until 1963, according to Michael E. Horwin
      writing for the Albany Law Journal of Science and Technology in 2003. And
      even after 1961, the American Journal of Cancer found contaminated oral
      vaccines. Although researchers know SV40 causes cancer in animals,
      opinions vary on a direct link between the virus and cancer in humans.
      Independent studies, however, have identified SV40 in brain and lung
      tumors of children and adults. The Centers for Disease Control did post a
      fact sheet acknowledging the presence of SV40 in polio vaccines but has
      since removed it, according to Medical Daily. Parts of the Gulf of Tonkin
      Incident, which led to US intervention in Vietnam, never happened: After
      evading a torpedo attack, the USS Maddox reportedly engaged three North
      Vietnamese boats in the Gulf of Tonkin on both August 2 and August 4,
      1964, according to the Pentagon Papers. Although without US casualties,
      the events prompted Congress to pass a resolution allowing President
      Lyndon Johnson to intervene in the Southeast Asian country. Talk of
      Tonkin's status as a "false flag" for US involvement in the Vietnam War
      has permeated public discourse almost since the time of the attacks,
      especially after the government admitted that the second incident may have
      involved false radar images. But after resisting comment for decades, the
      National Security Agency finally declassified documents in 2005, admitting
      the incident on August 4 never happened at all. Those involved didn't
      necessarily intend to cover-up the incident to propagate a war. But the
      evidence does suggest "an active effort to make SIGINT fit the claim of
      what happened during the evening of 4 August in the Gulf of Tonkin,"
      according to NSA historian Robert J. Hanyok. Military leaders reportedly
      planned terrorist attacks in the US to drum up support for a war against
      Cuba: In 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved Operation Northwoods, a
      covert plan to create support for a war in Cuba that would oust communist
      leader Fidel Castro. Declassified government documents show considerations
      included: host funerals for "mock-victims," "start rumors (many)," and
      "blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba." They even
      suggested somehow pinning John Glenn's potential death, should his rocket
      explode, on communists in Cuba. The advisers presented the plan to
      President Kennedy's secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, according to
      investigative journalist James Bamford's book, "Body of Secrets." We don't
      know whether McNamara immediately refused, but a few days later, Kennedy
      told US Army Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer, the plan's poo-bah, that the US
      would never use overt force to take Cuba. A few months later, Lemnitzer
      lost his position. "There really was a worry at the time about the
      military going off crazy and they did, but they never succeeded, but it
      wasn't for lack of trying," Bamford told ABC News. The government tested
      the effects of LSD on unwitting US and Canadian citizens: Under the code
      name "MKUltra," the US government ran a human-research operation within
      the CIA's Scientific Research Division. Researchers tested the effects of
      hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, torture, and, most memorably,
      LSD, on US and Canadian citizens. Most had no idea. To conduct these
      experiments, the CIA paid prisons, hospitals, and other institutions to
      keep quiet. The department even enticed heroin addicts to participate by
      offering them heroin, according to documents from a joint hearing to
      subcommittees of Congress, where then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, chairman of Health
      and Scientific Research subcommittee, spoke. That day, he regaled Congress
      with "chilling testimony." Over 30 universities became involved in various
      studies. Notably, many lacked oversight by medical or scientific
      professionals. At least one participant, Frank Olsen, died, reportedly
      from suicide after unknowingly ingesting LSD. In January 1973, the CIA's
      then director, Richard Helms, ordered the destruction of all documents
      pertaining to MKUltra. When Congress looked into the matter, no one, not
      even Helms, could "remember" details. Through a Freedom of Information Act
      (FOIA) request, more documents were located, but the full timeline remains
      incomplete. The events inspired investigative journalist Jon Ronson's
      best-selling book, "The Men Who Stare At Goats," now a movie of the same
      title starring George Clooney. In 1974, the CIA secretly resurfaced a
      sunken Soviet submarine with three nuclear-armed ballistic missiles: The
      CIA's secret "Project Azorian" aimed to raise a sunken Soviet submarine
      from the floor of the Pacific Ocean to retrieve three nuclear-armed
      ballistic missiles, each carrying a one-megaton nuclear warhead. With
      President Nixon's approval, CIA director Richard Helms placed all the
      plans in a secret file called "Jennifer," thus keeping the information
      from everyone but a select number of government officials. After a FOIA,
      the NSA finally published an article from the CIA's in-house journal,
      Studies in Intelligence, revealing that the department succeeded in
      resurfacing portions of the sub, named K-129. The CIA redacted text in
      these documents that prevent determining the operation's exact level of
      success, but the crew of the Glomar Explorer, the recovery ship, did haul
      contents to Hawaii for unloading. The US government sold weapons to Iran,
      violating an embargo, and used the money to support Nicaraguan militants:
      In 1985, senior officials in the Reagan administration facilitated the
      sale of arms to Iran, then under embargo. The government, with the
      National Security Council's Oliver North acting as a key player, later
      used the profits to fund the Contras, anticommunist rebels, in Nicaragua.
      The whole situation began with seven American hostages taken by a hostile
      group in Lebanon with ties to Iran. Through an elaborate exchange
      involving Israel, the US planned to sell weapons to Iran in exchange for
      the hostages' freedom. The situation quickly derailed, although the
      Lebanese did release all but two hostages. After a leak from an Iranian,
      the situation finally came to light in 1986. After repeatedly denying any
      involvement, the Reagan administration underwent 41 days of congressional
      hearings, according to Brown University's research project on the scandal.
      They subpoenaed government documents from as early as 1981 and forced
      declassification of others. Reagan's involvement in and even knowledge of
      the situation remains unclear. The hearings never labeled the sale of
      weapons to Iran a criminal offense, but some officials faced charges for
      supporting the Contras. The administration, however, refused to declassify
      certain documents, forcing Congress to drop them. A public-relations firm
      organized congressional testimony that propelled US involvement in the
      Persian Gulf War: In 1990, a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl identified only as
      "Nayirah" testified before Congress that she witnessed Iraqi soldiers
      pulling infants from their incubators at a hospital and tossing them to
      the ground to die. A later investigation revealed that PR giant Hill &
      Knowlton arranged her testimony for a client, Kuwaiti-sponsored Citizens
      for a Free Kuwait, and furthermore that Nayirah was the daughter of
      Kuwait's Ambassador to the US, according to The New York Times. Tom
      Lantos, a representative from California who cofounded the committee that
      heard Nayirah, coordinated the whole thing. Perhaps not coincidentally,
      his committee rented space in the PR firm's headquarters at a reduced
      rate. Citizens for a Free Kuwait would go on to donate money to
      foundations with ties to said committee sometime after Iraq's invasion of
      Kuwait. At first, Amnesty International affirmed the girl's testimony. But
      after reinvestigation, the group and other human-rights organizations
      switched positions. They didn't necessarily question the accuracy, just
      her withheld bias. Nayirah's testimony helped build support for the
      Persian Gulf War, though Congress would have likely pursued involvement
      without her words.
