        "Los Angeles ranks seventh in income inequality out of the largest 150
        metro regions. Inequality is driven, in part, by a widening gap in
        wages. Since 1979, the highest-paid workers have seen their wages
        increase by 13 percent, while wages for the lowest-paid workers have
        declined by 25 percent."
