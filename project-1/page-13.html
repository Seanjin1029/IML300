      "The highest levels of inequality in mortality risk are experienced by
      black men. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by
      police over the life course than are white men. Black women are about 1.4
      times more likely to be killed by police than are white women. Although
      risks are estimated with less precision for American Indian/Alaska Native
      men and women than for other groups, we show that they face a higher
      lifetime risk of being killed by police than do whites. American Indian
      men are between 1.2 and 1.7 times more likely to be killed by police than
      are white men, and American Indian women are between 1.1 and 2.1 times
      more likely to be killed by police than are white women."
